            "1 ) This course explores tropes, muses and icons of Black femininity in contemporary art. Graduate students enrolled in this seminar will consider diverse media, including photography, collage, craft and assemblage, as well as representations of the Black female body, of beauty and sexuality. In addition to reading canonic works in Black feminist theory, students will explore major works and exhibitions to consider the efforts of Black women art-makers from the 1960s through the 21st century.\n",

Produce semester-long documentary photography project and 5-10 page documentary essay on healthcare related topic. Students must have or quickly develop proficiency in the use of a digital SLR camera and Adobe Lightroom. Course materials include photographs, articles, and books. Class sessions combine critique of student work, discussion of course materials, and discussion of ethical questions involved in documentary representation of healthcare-related topics.\n",

Investigate risk and protective factors influencing the development of delinquency and crime, systemic and sociocultural factors, ethical controversies, and applied topics in criminal behavior. Students critically evaluate, synthesize, and debate cases in context of current empirical research. Interactive learning emphasized. Open only to students in the Focus Program.\n",
