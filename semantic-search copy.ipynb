The course will accomplish these goals by focusing on two broad sets of questions. First, what principles can you draw on to analyze and improve performance in organizations? We will examine principles for designing incentive systems, motivating employees, running effective teams, making good decisions, harnessing diversity, and organizing the distribution of work. The second set of questions concerns what you need to do as an individual to be an effective leader. What can you contribute to your firm and why should others respect and listen to you?

In this course we will examine the link between human rights and conflict in an interdisciplinary fashion. What are the multiple ways in which the law and political advocacy of human rights relate to conflict? Do demands for human rights precipitate or fuel as much as prevent-conflicts, whether as war or in other forms of large scale suffering? Are human rights essential for what the field of conflict resolution has termed 'positive peace'? Should policymakers involved in multiple stages of conflict, both inter-and intrastate, be more cautious about viewing rights as a remedy for conflicts? What are relevant ethical considerations? With the benefit of greater analytical and contextual understanding of competing priorities and tradeoffs, what positive role might be cast for human rights in the conflicts of the 21st century? To consider these and other questions, we will draw substantially on historical and policy analyses, learning the legal/political history of the contemporary framework for human rights and connecting it to real world efforts underway by lawyers and other practitioners to reframe and transform conflict and build peace.
