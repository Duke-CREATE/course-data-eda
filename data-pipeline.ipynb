Emphases will include project financing, notions of options as applied to internal financial analysis, allocation of costs and revenues for new high tech projects, valuing projects and valuing firms when intellectual assets are a significant portion of total level value; corporate control in high tech firms. Finance issues in mergers, acquisitions, and alliances.  Prerequisite: enrollment in the Master of Engineering Management Program.\n",

The physiology of human organ systems will be covered, with emphasis on the critical concept of homeostasis, cellular physiology, nervous systems, cardiovascular systems, renal physiology, and muscle system. Clinical scenarios will be incorporated throughout the course so that students can think critically about how disrupting the normal structure and function of the human body leads to disease processes. Open to graduate students only; students who have taken BME 244L are not eligible to take this course.\n",

Projects at the intersection of engineering and business will be chosen for this practicum.  Students will work in teams and will conduct a mentored, semester-long project for an organization.  The learning objectives of this course include: (i) learn how engineering and technology impact organizations and how they are integrated into an organization to achieve desired results; (ii) understand, through an experiential environment, how organizations function and the difference between theory and implementation in an organizational setting; and (iii) develop team based skills in an applied environment and learn how to communicate technical issues to a variety of personnel in an organization.
